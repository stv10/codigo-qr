## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice flexbox and styling with css, i found it very useful and give me the chance to get a better knowledge about how flex containers work and resize

```html
    <main id="container">
      <div id="card">
        <div id="img-div">
          <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR CODE">
        </div>
        <div id="desc">
          <h4>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h4> 
          <p>Scan thr QR code to visit FrontEnd Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
```

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Talking about learning i would like your advice about this breakpoints i made, it is the only way i know to make a responsive page, i am sure there is a better approach for this, with some function maybe or another tool i miss
```css
@media (max-width: 1200px) {
    #card {
        width: 23%;
    }
  }

  @media (max-width: 1100px) {
    #card {
        width: 25%;
    }
  }

  @media (max-width: 1000px) {
    #card {
        width: 27%;
    }
  }
  ```

  and like this ones i made a lot more...
